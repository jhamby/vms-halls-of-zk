-- Edit History:

-- 08-JUL-85 WBL Cleaned up specification of object attributes.  Put all
--		 'takes up' fields on one line, 'limit' fields on another.
--		 Also remove reference to field if it is zero, and static
--		 objects have no need of 'takes up' values.  If an object
--		 can hold objects then it needs strength - for all objects but
--		 self use 'infinite'.
--
-- 09-JUL-85 WBL Added READABLE attribute.  Objects should have DETAIL if they
--		 are readable.  The message 'the foo reads:<cr><cr>' is appended
--		 automatically.
--
-- 14-JUL-85 WBL Added OPENABLE bit.  These objects are initially CLOSED.
--
-- 15-JUL-85 WBL Added LOCKABLE bit.  These objects are initially LOCKED.
--
-- 17-JUL-85 WBL Added STARTABLE, MACHINE and COGNIZANT (aware) attributes.
--		 All default to off
--
-- 01-AUG-85 EDS Changed the devo's (CDD,VMS,STAN) to be non-static. This
--               way they will respond (COGNIZANT) rather than begin 'fixed'
--
-- 02-AUG-85 WBL Made cognizant objects static again just in case.  Changed
--		 order of checks so that the 'keep off' message will come before
--		 the 'fixed' message

-- Attribute Summary:

-- DETAIL identifier		Text for EXAMINE or READ command
-- NAME string			Name of object
-- INITIAL identifier		Identifier is a room name

-- STRENGTH number or STRENGTH INFINITE
--	Maximum total weight this object can hold.  If object has CAPACITY or
--	AREA it must have strength.  Default is STRENGTH 0.

-- CAPACITY number or CAPACITY INFINITE
--	Max volume available to hold stuff put INSIDE. CAPACITY<=VOLUME
--	Default is CAPACITY 0 (holds nothing).  For doors, capacity refers
--	to the largest volume allowed to pass through.  The volume of the
--	self and the thing you're pushing are checked.

-- AREA number or AREA INFINITE
--	Max area available to hold stuff put ON.  AREA<=SIZE
--	Default is AREA 0 (nothing may be put on the object)

-- MASS number
--	How much of another object's STRENGTH this object takes up
--	Default is MASS 0
-- VOLUME number
--	How much of another object's CAPACITY this object takes up
--	Default is VOLUME 0
-- SIZE number
--	How much of another object's AREA this object takes up
--	Default is SIZE 0

-- STATIC	Object can't be TAKEN, PUT, DROPPED, etc
-- READABLE	Detail text is words which can be read
-- OPENABLE	OPEN/CLOSE work on this object.  Initial state is closed.
-- LOCKABLE	LOCK/UNLOCK work on this object.  Initial state is locked.
-- STARTABLE	START/STOP work on this object.  Initial state is stopped.
-- COGNIZANT	Object is intelligent.  People, computers, etc
-- MACHINE	Object is a machine.  Coke machine, lamp, computer, etc
-- ROOM		Object is a room.
-- FLEXIBLE	Does the effective volume of the object depend on what's
--		currently inside it?
--		Say sack is Vol=15, Cap=10
--		If flexible and nothing inside it, its effective
--		volume is 5 instead of 15
