Tired of the same old pirates, thieves, Cyclops, wizards, dragons, horsemen,
chiefs, spiders, weasel-like aliens and dungeon masters?  Tired of traveling
in spaceships, magic boats, magic barrels, spinning rooms and time machines?
Tired of telling the robot where to go?  Tired of paying $$$ for personal
computer games you can't even relate to?  Have we got an escape for you?!

Announcing ZK, the first interactive fiction game written exclusively for the
VAX!  ZK is an sophisticated adventure game which takes place at Digital's
Spitbrook software engineering facility.  Meet famous Spitbrook personalities!
Incredible treasures and mind-boggling encounters await you. Exercise your
computer-related skills to solve the myriad of obstacles that lead to the
acquisition of the ultimate treasure!

ZK requires VAX/VMS version 4.0 or later.  For reasons beyond our control
performance will be poor on 4.0 and 4.1 systems.  ZK is screen-based and
must be played on a video terminal.  The latest release can always be copied
from {AURORA,GUIDO,NOD}::SYS$GAMES:ZK.EXE.  A notes file has also been
established at {AURORA,GUIDO,NOD}::SYS$NOTES:ZK for bug reports and general
discussions of the game.

Enjoy!
