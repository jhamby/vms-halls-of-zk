	Work Items for Computer Problem

1.	Fixing the game such at you can only put logical things in the
	disk drive and the tape drive.

	check.

2.	Distinguish between START and BOOT.  START means turn on, while
	BOOT means get the OS running.

	there must be instructions somewhere for these suttle differences.
	how about on a hardware manaual lieing around.

3.	Make console work:
		Have variable, last message on console.  When you read
		the console you get the last message sent there.

	good. 'EXAM CONSOLE'

4.	Error for BOOT with no disk in drive

	message on console "ZK-F- must have a valid system disk, no scratch"

5.	If BOOT with scratch disk in drive
		Failure
		Service gnome appears
		give disk to field service rep
		returns system disk

6.	If BOOT with system disk in drive, message on console
		"Standalone ZKINSTALL is running and waiting..."

7.	If take disk out while booted, what happens?

	They die. They get a face full of magnetic disk.

8.	if INSTALL <product> with no tape in drive, error

	ZKINSTALL-F- media not in drive.

9.	if INSTALL <product> with different product in drive, error

	ZKINSTAL-F- INVAILID TAPE ON DRIVE ! see comment below.

10.	Order of installation is VMS, CDD, DTR

11.	If wrong order then "ZKINSTAL-W- PREREQUISITE PRODUCT REQUIRED"

12.	If already installed then "ZKINSTAL-W- PRODUCT ALREADY INSTALLED"

13.	What happens when they boot the vax with all products installed?
	SPAWN to $ level?

	Fine. No, Great.

14.	What happens if they just install VMS.  and don't install CDD!!!!!

	Well??




Commands:

	start vax
	boot vax
	put system disk in disk drive
	put vms tape in tape drive
	install vms
						! What if they stop here
	take vms tape from disk drive
	put cdd tape in tape drive
	install cdd
						! What if they stop here
	take cdd tape from disk drive
	put dtr tape in tape drive
	install dtr


Comments:

	I think the command 'INSTAL [product]' should be just 'INSTALL'.
	Having the product name buys you nothing except error checking.
	Beside people will try '*' and stuff like that. The instructions
	for install say that it will install whatever's on the mag tape.
