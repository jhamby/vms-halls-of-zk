Dave's recent comments:

(1) In lobby, guard's response to take keys has bad grammer.

	This is the plural/singular problem again.  Use of 'set of keys'
	has temporarily fixed this problem but its a crock.  The problem
	is that the code which prefixes 'some' or 'a' or 'an' doesn't apply
	to all messages.  Therefore for the messages which expect singular
	objects, 'set of keys' works ok.  For messages which see an 's' on
	the end of the object and append 'some', the object name
	'some set of keys' doesn't make it.

(2) Blue hall, N of elevator, a passage SW is described which is not
    implemented.

	TRUE.  I have fixed this.

(3) Diet Quiz - delicacy is spelled wrong

	TRUE.  I fixed this yesterday or the day before.  He's playing
	Sunday's last production compile.

(4) ED's office, examine listings. 

	I suppose he means 'the listings reads'...
	You seem to have changed this recently, removing READABLE from
	the detail of the listings.  Again singular/plural problem.

(5) The rooms RED_PASSAGE_1 and RED_PASSAGE_2 have the name
    'End of red passage'.

	This was a cut/paste problem.  We never noticed all the red
	passage rooms said 'end of red passage'. I have fixed this.

(6) Could the phrase EXAMINE WALL be implemented.

	To mean LOOK ON ROOM, I guess, will consider
