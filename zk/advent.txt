35,You are obviously a rank amateur.  Better luck next time.
100,Your score qualifies you as a novice class adventurer.
130,You have achieved the rating: "experienced adventurer".
200,You may now consider yourself a "seasoned adventurer".
250,You have reached "junior master" status.
300,Your score puts you in master adventurer class C.
330,Your score puts you in master adventurer class B.
349,Your score puts you in master adventurer class A.
9999,All of adventuredom gives tribute to you, adventurer grandmaster!

142,If you want to end your adventure early, say "quit".  To suspend your
142,adventure such that you can continue later, say "suspend" (or "pause"
142,or "save").  To see what hours the cave is normally open, say "hours".
142,To see how well you're doing, say "score".  To get full credit for a
142,treasure, you must have left it safely in the building, though you get
142,partial credit just for locating it.  You lose points for getting
142,killed, or for quitting, though the former costs you more.  There are
142,also points based on how much (if any) of the cave you've managed to
142,explore; in particular, there is a large bonus just for getting in (to
142,distinguish the beginners from the rest of the pack), and there are
142,other ways to determine whether you've been through some of the more
142,harrowing sections.  If you think you've found all the treasures, just
142,keep exploring for a while.  If nothing interesting happens, you
142,haven't found them all yet.  If something interesting *does* happen,
142,it means you're getting a bonus and have an opportunity to garner many
142,more points in the master's section.  I may occasionally offer hints
142,if you seem to be having trouble.  If I do, I'll warn you in advance
142,how much it will affect your score to accept the hints.  Finally, to
142,save paper, you may specify "brief", which tells me never to repeat
142,the full description of a place unless you explicitly ask me to.

51,I know of places, actions, and things.  Most of my vocabulary
51,describes places and is used to move you there.  To move, try words
51,like forest, building, downstream, enter, east, west, north, south,
51,up, or down.  I know about a few special objects, like a black rod
51,hidden in the cave.  These objects can be manipulated using some of
51,the action words that I know.  Usually you will need to give both the
51,object and action words (in either order), but sometimes I can infer
51,the object from the verb alone.  Some objects also imply verbs; in
51,particular, "inventory" implies "take inventory", which causes me to
51,give you a list of what you're carrying.  The objects have side
51,effects; for instance, the rod scares the bird.  Usually people having
51,trouble moving just need to try a few more words.  Usually people
51,trying unsuccessfully to manipulate an object are attempting something
51,beyond their (or my!) capabilities and should try a completely
51,different tack.  To speed the game you can sometimes move long
51,distances with a single word.  For example, "building" usually gets
51,you to the building from anywhere above ground except when lost in the
51,forest.  Also, note that cave passages turn a lot, and that leaving a
51,room to the north does not guarantee entering the next from the south.

000,There are a few recent issues of "Spelunker Today" magazine here.

126,You are on the edge of a breath-taking view.  Far below you is an
126,active volcano, from which great gouts of molten lava come surging
126,out, cascading back down into the depths.  The glowing rock fills the
126,farthest reaches of the cavern with a blood-red glare, giving every-
126,thing an eerie, macabre appearance.  The air is filled with flickering
126,sparks of ash and a heavy smell of brimstone.  The walls are hot to
126,the touch, and the thundering of the volcano drowns out all other
126,sounds.  Embedded in the jagged roof far overhead are myriad twisted
126,formations composed of pure white alabaster, which scatter the murky
126,light into sinister apparitions upon the walls.  To one side is a deep
126,gorge, filled with a bizarre chaos of tortured rock which seems to
126,have been crafted by the devil himself.  An immense river of fire
126,crashes out from the depths of the volcano, burns its way through the
126,gorge, and plummets into a bottomless pit far off to your left.  To
126,the right, an immense geyser of blistering steam erupts continuously
126,from a barren island in the center of a sulfurous lake, which bubbles
126,ominously.  The far right wall is aflame with an incandescence of its
126,own, which lends an additional infernal splendor to the already
126,hellish scene.  A dark, foreboding passage exits to the south.
